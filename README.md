## 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
A machine learning project that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.
This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of breast cancer significantly increases survival rates.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify tumors based on medical diagnostic features.

1. The workflow includes:

2. Data preprocessing

3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

4. Feature engineering

5. Model building (Multiple ML algorithms)

6. Model evaluation

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, which contains:

# 569 samples
# 30 numeric diagnostic features
# Classification label:

      0 → Malignant
      1 → Benign

You can download the dataset directly from:

    1. Scikit-learn datasets module, or

   2.  UCI Machine Learning Repository
